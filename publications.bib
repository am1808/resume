abstract = {The time independent Schr¨ odinger equation is a differential equation of great interest in computational physics. In many cases, it is impossible to reach an analytical solution for it, due to the potential function complexity, therefore numerical methods play an important role in its solution for practical cases. By means of numerical methods it is possible to solve the stationary Schr¨ odinger equation for arbitrary potentials, allowing the study of interesting potentials that exhibit fascinating phenomena. Some of these potentials are the Kronig-Penney and pseudo- Coulomb potential functions, or more single like barrier potential function. Nevertheless, in many cases, the implementation of the sequence of steps needed to solve the differential equation is not straightforward. In this work we present and explain a sequence of steps to solving the time independent Schr¨ odinger equation by means of the variational method, and apply it to solve non-periodic potential functions, like the harmonic oscillator potential well and rectangular potential barrier, and periodic potential functions like the Kronig-Penney and pseudo- Coulomb. Our main purpose is for this work to be an introduction to the computational quantum mechanics field.},

abstract = {Abstract Thermal and hysteretic magnetic properties of La 2 / 3 Ca 1 / 3 MnO 3 nanoparticles were studied using Monte Carlo simulations, with emphasis on the influence of anisotropy. In this work, several nanoparticle sizes ranging from 2.32 to 11.58 nm were analyzed and their properties were compared to those of the bulk material. The magnetic behavior of the material was modeled using the three dimensional Heisenberg model with nearest neighbor interactions. Furthermore, both uniaxial and N{\'{e}}el anisotropies were considered for core and surface magnetic sites respectively. Deviations in the critical temperature and coercive field were observed for nanoparticles when compared with those of the bulk material. In addition to these properties, the special spin configurations that arise from the competition between the exchange, anisotropy and external magnetic field were also studied. All these effects are interpreted in terms of the surface properties such as the N{\'{e}}el anisotropy and the decrease in the coordination number. },

abstract = {Abstract In this work we present a new design of Co based bit pattern media with out-of-plane uni-axial anisotropy induced by interface effects. Our model features the inclusion of magnetic impurities in the non-magnetic matrix. After the material model was refined during three iterations using Monte Carlo simulations, further simulations were performed using an atomistic integrator of Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation with Langevin dynamics to study the behavior of the system paying special attention to the super-paramagnetic limit. Our model system exhibits three magnetic phase transitions, one due to the magnetically doped matrix material and the weak magnetic interaction between the nano-structures in the system. The different magnetic phases of the system as well as the features of its phase diagram are explained. },

abstract = {An atomistic scale study of ultra-thin ferromagnetic films was carried out using Monte Carlo simulations with Metropolis dynamics, and the simulations were performed using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, surface and crystalline anisotropies, and dipolar interaction. We defined an parameter to bind the dipolar interaction with the anisotropy in order to show how the system would behave at different ratios and scale up the dipolar interaction to observe its effects on small manageable systems. The results show a strong dependency of the shape of the magnetization curves for in-plane and out-of-plane measurements with our parameter. We also included several measures of the magnetization direction at T = 2.5 K after a cooling process, and they show a critical thickness for an below which the magnetization will spontaneously beat the shape anisotropy and become perpendicular to the surface at low temperatures. As a side note, our study also shows results consistent with previous simulations that focused in a in-plane to out-of-plane transition of the magnetization when going from high temperature to low temperature.},

abstract = {In this work, magnetic and magnetotransport properties of ferromagnetic (FM)/antiferromagnetic (AF) (La2/3Ca1/3MnO3/La1/3Ca2/3MnO3)n (n = 1, 3, 5, 8) manganite multilayers using the standard Monte Carlo method were studied. Simulations of a three-dimensional classical Heisenberg model implemented with a single spin-flip Metropolis dynamics were performed. The Hamiltonian included four different superexchange interactions, according with the two different types of ions Mn3+ and Mn4+. Also, the orbital differences accounting for the Mn3+ ions were considered. Likewise, the Hamiltonian included terms dealing with magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the influence of an external magnetic field. Samples were simulated with dimensions L 2(d FM + d AF), where L stands for the lateral dimension along which periodic boundary conditions were implemented and d F M and d A F stand for the thicknesses of FM and AF layers, respectively, with free boundary conditions. In particular, low-temperature results reveal the behavior of the magnetoresistance depending of the thickness and the number of bilayers.},

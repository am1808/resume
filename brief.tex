            I deliver on-site courses to the department of exact and natural
            sciences at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, in a contract
            basis. I delivered Simulation 1 for Engineering Physics in the
            first term of 2016 and Informatics 3 for Engineering Physics in the
            second term of 2016 and in the current term. Notes for the
            Informatics 3 course are partially available at
            \url{https://odarbelaeze.github.io/teaching}

        {Full stack software engineer}
        {BairesDev}

        {}
        {%
            I deliver full stack contractor software engineering services to
            \href{https://www.adroll.com/}{AdRoll} through
            \href{http://www.bairesdev.com/}{BairesDev}. My main
            responsibilities include to write and mantain backend and frontend
            code that allow advertisers to run native ad campaigns through
            AdRoll.

        {%
            Mainly I had to give advice and aid the process of purchasing a
            small high performance computing cluster for a research group in
            the Department of Physics of the university, furthermore I had to
            install the cluster out of the bare bone servers in order to
            optimize the cost and perform maintenance operations. Furthermore,
            my responsibilities included teaching people how to take advantage
            of the cluster and to build a website to improve the communication
            process within and outside the research group. The main
            accomplishment I achieved during this time was to have a 100\%
            occupancy for several months.

        {Summer intern}
        {Computational Magnetism Group, University of York}
        {United Kindom}
        {}
        {%
            In this internship I had the responsibility of leading a small
            development team and code in order to add a new feature to the
            \textsc{Vampire} physics simulation code. The challenge of the
            project was to integrate CUDA support into a mainly serial and MPI
            C++ codebase. The feature is still in PR waiting for polising and
            approval \url{https://github.com/richard-evans/vampire/pull/4}

            For this job I had a managerial position where I had to lead a
            small development team in order to deliver a production version of
            the Tree of Science tool now hosted at \url{http://tos.manizales.unal.edu.co}.
            The main challenge here was the poor timing for starting the
            project because I spent most of the development cycle halfway
            across the world. Therefore, I had to learn how to communicate
            effectively with my team from far away and then assuming the
            responsibility as a manager for the missteps of the team and
            finally manage to deliver the product on time.
